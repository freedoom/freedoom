$(basename "$0") could not locate nor launch a Doom engine.  Most
likely, you simply need to install one, check your distribution
package repositories for names such as "prboom" or "odamex" or seek
out one and install it manually.

If you believe you already have one, you may just need to modify your
PATH environment variable to include it, or set up the $HOME/.doomport
symbolic link to point directly to the engine of your choice.
