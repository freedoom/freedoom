This directory contains "miscellaneous" graphics that are not textures
or sprites. For the most part these are elements of the user interface,
but it also includes full-screen artwork images such as the title
screen (TITLEPIC), intermission screen background (INTERPIC) and story
screens.

Many of the files for this directory are automatically generated by the
textgen script (see the textgen/ subdirectory).

In general, here's a simple guide to most of the contents of this
directory, based on filename:

 * m_*.png        - Elements of the main menu
 * stcfn*.png     - Characters used for displaying on-screen messages
                    seen during gameplay
 * st*.png        - Elements of the status bar
 * wi*.png        - Elements of the intermission screens
