This directory contains the source wadinfo text file used for Freedoom.

WadInfo (not to be confused with DeuTex wadinfo) is a traditional
text file format distributed with Doom wads. It contains information
about the authors, the contents of the WAD, the requirements for
running it, and permissions for use.
Freedoom embeds one in each of its IWADs to ensure that the information
reaches all players.

The Makefile in this directory splits the wadinfo into three parts
for each IWAD to match their description and technical details.
