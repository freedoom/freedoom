# The following changes turn on full brightness for a few firing frames,
# since these they show gun flashes and it looks weird if they aren't full
# brightness. Doom itself has this problem too but it's more noticeable with
# the Freedoom sprites.

# Zombie
Frame 185
Sprite subnumber = 32773

# Minigun zombie
Frame 419
Sprite subnumber = 32773

# Assault tripod
Frame 685
Sprite subnumber = 32773

Frame 687
Sprite subnumber = 32773

Frame 689
Sprite subnumber = 32773

# A_PosAttack and A_CPosAttack use identical formulae
# and the same number of RNG calls to determine the
# attack; the only difference other than the way the
# information is organized is the sound being played.
# Having the minigunner and sailor call A_PosAttack
# makes them not sound confusingly similar to the large
# technospider's much more powerful shotgunguy-like attack.

# Minigunner using A_PosAttack
Pointer 234 (Frame 417)
Codep Frame = 185

Pointer 235 (Frame 418)
Codep Frame = 185

# Sailor using A_PosAttack
Pointer 234 (Frame 738)
Codep Frame = 185

Pointer 235 (Frame 740)
Codep Frame = 185

# The super shotgun's first frame is 7 tics long before it
# begins its reload sequence, but the muzzle flash animation
# totals 9 tics, causing the flash to trail behind the gun.
# This shortens the flash down to exactly 7 tics.

Frame 47
Duration = 4

Frame 48
Duration = 3

E1TEXT = Free at last from that dreadful outpost!\n\
         But you're still stuck on this rock, with\n\
         AGM and all their monstrous "experiments."\n\
         Best not to dwell on what evil horrors\n\
         they were going to create from you...\n\n\
         Damn alien teleporter ate your gear.\n\
         The air is hot and muggy, and smells of\n\
         strange, intoxicating vegetation. You see\n\
         what looks like AGM corpo tech patched\n\
         over old, overgrown alien structures.\n\
         Nothing close to the tech needed for this\n\
         existed at the outpost, meaning there must\n\
         be a starport nearby. To Earth. To freedom.\n\n\
         Just gotta hope that ship will launch\n\
         from these routed, infested ruins...
E2TEXT = The massive brutes collapse onto the\n\
         ground, falling apart bit by bit.\n\
         The starport is yours.\n\n\
         But no ship: the launch bay sits empty,\n\
         leaving only a massive teleporter pad.\n\
         Limited inorganics. Fixed destination.\n\n\
         The name suggests it's probably the new\n\
         AGM ship hub in this remote star cluster.\n\
         Bastards owe you for what they've done,\n\
         so what even is interstellar piracy\n\
         but a bit of D.I.Y. law enforcement?\n\n\
         You board the platform and fade away.\n\
         Next stop: Horizon.
E3TEXT = The abomination explodes into oblivion.\n\
         What the hell even was that?\n\n\
         As the shadow sets over this red rock,\n\
         you realize that you're now trapped here.\n\
         At least you've got more space in this\n\
         wasteland than your old cell.\n\n\
         You kick the corpse in anger, and it feels\n\
         good. You kick it again, and a remote falls\n\
         out. You press the button, and the ground\n\
         gives way to reveal a teleporter. You look\n\
         at the gizmo - it says "To Double Impact."\n\n\
         Wherever or whatever that is, you pray\n\
         to any listening deity that there's\n\
         a working ship on the other side.
E4TEXT = Suppressing fire echoes above as the last\n\
         survivors flee the ship. The launch process\n\
         is irreversible: killing you now would only\n\
         bring a slow death drifting through space.\n\n\
         Fifty-nine. Fifty-eight. Fifty-seven. .  .\n\
         You melt into the pilot's seat, lost in the\n\
         voice of an automated assembly of angels\n\
         delivering you from this wretched rock.\n\n\
         The ship rumbles as she wakes up;\n\
         you think of Earth as she lifts off.\n\
         Hopefully AGM won't find you there:\n\
         they've got the outbreak to deal with,\n\
         so that'll give you some time.\n\n\
         Destination: Earth!

         Despite all the other destruction they've\n\
         wrought, the teleportation infrastructure\n\
         remains intact - you might be able to\n\
         get back to civilization this way.\n\n\
         You find an old pad and boot it up.\n\
         Connection live. Handshake established.\n\n\
         Growling and chittering on the intercom.\n\n\
         Planted your feet.\n\
         Checked your weapons.\n\

# After MAP11, before MAP12:

         The fighting is taking its toll on you.\n\
         The pain. The brutality. The loneliness.\n\
         There's got to be a way to somewhere,\n\
         something that isn't... this.\n\n\
         A train rumbles in the distance.\n\n\
         You follow the sound down the empty road\n\
         and reach the edge of a railyard.\n\n\
         Trains mean cities.\n\
         Cities mean people.\n\n\
         Right?
# After MAP20, before MAP21:
C3TEXT = Here is no AGM but only monsters.\n\
         Monsters, no humans and dusty days\n\
         sleeping in old ruins and eating scraps.\n\
         No one has escaped this wasteland alive.\n\n\
         You've been tracking their movements.\n\
         AGM records and alien scrawlings point\n\
         to something big worming its way through\n\
         the entire teleportation network.\n\
         Sending its nightmare armies of brain-\n\
         scrambled sapients - including humans -\n\
         to conquer all known space.\n\n\
         And now you're fighting at its doorstep.\n\n\
         This could be the beginning\n\
         of your freedom - or your doom.
# After MAP30 (endgame text):

         unaware of its master's demise.\n\n\
         On the other side you see a small town.\n\
         You ditch your weapons and slip through,\n\
         leaving AGM and all its horrors behind.\n\n\
         No one will know who saved them.\n\n\
         No one will know what happened here.\n\n\
         No one will ever find you again.
# Before MAP31 (secret level #1):
C5TEXT = You step into the teleporter. You feel a\n\
         familiar flash and... you're in a cage?\n\
         Jailed?\n\n\
         There are other cages in here. Occupied.\n\
         So is this how they capture humans?\n\
         Or did they set this up specially for you,\n\
         as a reward for being such a monkey wrench\n\
         in their plans?\n\n\
         The guards haven't noticed you - yet.\n\
         Any noise could mean death. Or worse.\n\n\
         When they zombify you, are you awake the\n\
         entire time, locked inside of your brain?\n\n\
         You'd rather not find out.
# Before MAP32 (secret level #2):
C6TEXT = Forcibly uncaged again. Good job.\n\n\
         But where are you? The air and gravity\n\
         still feel like whatever planet that\n\
         strange prison had been on.\n\n\
         You look around and the layout triggers\n\
         some old memories from history class.\n\n\
         This is an arena.\n\
         Where they send prisoners to die.\n\
         That wasn't an exit - but an entrance.\n\n\
         You will find your way back to the city,\n\
         but it will have to be on the other side\n\
         of a few homicidal mutants...
