For Phase 1 and 2, do not have a multiplayer demo in the DEMO1 slot.
Vanilla Doom (and some source ports) do not allow using the “load
game” option while in a network game, and network game demos count as
such.  The other three demo slots are fair game, since they do not
near-immediately block out the load game functionality when starting
Freedoom.

FreeDM is exempted since it is not intended to be a single-player
game.

For each demo the "by" refers to the creator of the demo, not the
corresponding level. The version at the end of each demo line is the
version when the demo was first released.
